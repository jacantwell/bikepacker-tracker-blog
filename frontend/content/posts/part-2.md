It was time to head upwards. The route I had planned headed east from Bilbao across the edge of the Pyrenees. One of the downsides of bikepacking is net elevation gain and this is exactly what faced me heading away from the coast. An 11km climb up into the Navarre region of Spain. Luckily the climbs in Europe tend to be of the longer and more gentler kind than those in the UK. Being used to the 12% climbs of the coastal roads around Exeter or the horrendous 20% incline found on the Dartmoor lanes, the "gentle" but seemingly everlasting 7% climb up to the plateau was a walk in the park. I was very happy with my decision to fit a tiny 32t chainring as it meant, even with my hefty bike, I could comfortably spin up the climb.

The real struggle was the heat. It seemed as though I had started my journey at the beginning of a heatwave. I had expected the climate to be roughly similar to the UK; however, temperatures were already hitting 30 degrees, which I certainly wasn't prepared for.

After besting the climb I enjoyed following the flat roads along the top of the plateau until diverting from a small town in search of water and, more importantly, a coffee. It turns out I had chosen the perfect town to pass through. I climbed up to the centre and entered the town square containing a number of cafés, all very Spanish and all with tables full of very Spanish people. I was taking my pick of café when surprisingly I heard someone ask in English if I was from Exeter. It turns out I wasn't the only Brit searching for coffee in this town; two fellow cyclists were also there and I decided to join them for a late lunch. I got myself a coffee and bocadilla (for only 3 euros!) and sat with them for a while chatting about the amazing cycling and being very envious of their lovely, unladen, carbon bikes.

When meeting these cyclists I think part of me was quite jealous, thinking maybe I had made the wrong decision and perhaps I would have been happier just staying where I was and enjoying nice cycling holidays on a nice new bike. This feeling stuck as I departed the café, said goodbye and continued along the flat roads of the plateau. 

I had once again scouted out a couple of camping spots but I didn't have high hopes for them. 60km later the spots came and went and I began the search for a proper camping spot. I had been following the main road for most of the day and decided to divert off onto some side lanes in hope that they would provide more potential fields to choose from. The issue was there seemed to be a lot of livestock farms around this area and every good-looking spot ended up having a herd of sheep or cows within. I am always hesitant of fields in areas like this even if they are empty; one of my irrational fears is that in the night or early morning the farmer is going to come and move a herd of angry animals into my camping spot and ruin my night. Of course the chances of this happening are very low, but still it was enough to put me off some of the empty fields I passed by. 

After some off-road excursions and considering sleeping in a bus shelter-like structure on an abandoned train platform, I came across a field that looked like it would do the job. At this point it must have been close to 32 degrees as every time I stopped I instantly became drenched in sweat. This spot was slightly shaded at the edge of a field and I quickly took off my bags and had a sit down under the trees. This is when I began to notice the sheer number of mosquitos surrounding me. I smacked one on my leg and a splash of blood spurted out; that was enough to make me want to move on. I quickly packed my bike back up in a frantic whirlwind of swatting and swinging at mosquitos, then back out into the sun in search of a new spot. I wasn't too stressed as it was only about 6pm at this point, so there were plenty of hours of sunlight remaining to find a spot. Though, annoyingly, the lane I had been following had brought me straight back to the main road. My only options from here were to continue following the big road or divert up what looked like a very large climb. I told myself I would do the first 300m of climbing just in case there was the perfect spot just around the corner. I am very glad I made this decision as, as soon as I turned the corner, I could see up the steep bank to my left there was an electric pylon built onto a large flat concrete slab with what looked like a decent amount of flat ground behind it. I dumped my bike in a ditch and scrambled up the little path to check it out. It was perfect; there was enough space on the grass for my tent and the concrete provided a nice flat and clean surface for sitting and cooking on. I then made the two trips to carry both my bags and bike up the steep path and had a sit down in the shade to cool off.

After I stopped sweating I "washed" off the lovely layer of suncream and sweat covering my arms and legs using my water bottle and got on with setting up camp and cooking some food. It was a beautiful spot to camp at; the sun was setting behind me and highlighting the ridge line in front of me that I had been following all day. It was a very relaxing evening in the end and I slept well. Without putting the outer on my tent the temperature was much nicer and more comfortable.

I had a very relaxed morning packing up my stuff and having some baguette and pate for breakfast. I only had a relatively flat 100km to cycle so I knew I could take my time. I was continuing to follow the same river that would take me past Pamplona; here the plan was to stop off at Decathlon to pick up some more electrolytes and hopefully some more cheap brake pads. I quickly realised setting off at 9 may have been a mistake as it was already starting to get too hot. I decided to press on and not stop until I got to the Decathlon. I realised about 10km in that I had forgotten to brush my teeth and found some joy brushing my teeth while cycling despite getting some odd looks from cyclists passing the other way. After some surprisingly tough climbing through a couple of little villages where the percentage hit upwards of 14%, I made it to Pamplona. Sadly Decathlon had no brake pads, but they did have plenty of electrolytes so I stocked up and then went to treat myself to a little rest in a McDonald's across the road. I made use of the wifi to plan my cycles for the next few days and to scout out some camping spots; the highlight of the stop though was simply enjoying the AC as it was now about 1pm and really starting to heat up. With routes planned and spots scouted I slathered myself in factor 50 before heading off. I was excited and optimistic for my end destination, a man-made lake (Embalse de Yesa) where, thanks to some helpful blog posts online, I knew you could both swim and camp.

It was another day of following big open roads and being very sweaty; my Wahoo got up to 38 degrees which was slightly concerning, but I continued on drinking as much as possible and stopping for water where I could. In the afternoon I treated myself to another café stop in a little village where I enjoyed a coffee and ice cream in the shade, before pushing on to tackle the final climbs of the day up to the lake. 


![image](https://jaspercycles.com/content/images/icecream-1.jpg) My planned route was to follow the right-hand side of the lake where on Google Maps there appeared to be a gravel track which looked perfect for finding a quiet camping spot along. I got to the top of the final climb which gave me a great view over the lake as well as a great view of the very closed-looking side roads that should be linking up to my gravel path. The roads I thought I would be able to cycle down were beginning to look a lot more like service roads for the large dam at the end of the lake. As I got to my exit, as expected it was closed off with a big locked gate. This was disappointing but not the end of the world; I knew I could instead follow the main road along the left-hand side of the lake. Almost instantly there was a gravel turn-off into what could very well have been a car park. I turned into it with the hope I would be able to get down to the lake's edge and find somewhere to camp and more importantly swim. I quickly spotted a few little rabbit runs down to the water but nowhere that looked ideal to camp; most of the ground was covered in shrubbery or just too steep to consider camping on. Luckily around the corner there was a little valley-like area that was flat at the bottom. It was a steep scramble down, one I knew I wouldn't get my bike down, but at this point I was very happy to settle for leaving my bike at the top of the hill and just taking my bags down.

All I could think about was getting in the water. Now I knew I could camp here I dumped my bike, grabbed a few of my things to take down to the water: towel, fresh clothes, etc. I got straight into the water, bib shorts still on; it was amazing. The perfect temperature to cool off but not too cold. I just floated there relaxing until I heard a car pulling up above me. With a slight panic for the safety of my bike I quickly got out of the water and scrambled back up to the "car park" to find it was just a campervan intruding on my spot for the night (how dare they). Now that I was out of the water I had great motivation to set up my camp quickly so I could get back in. I lugged my bags down into the flat area, struggled to get my tent pegs into the very hard and dry ground but eventually managed to get everything set up. I was then straight back into the water to enjoy it fully before the sun dipped behind the hills behind me.

As I dried off and walked back to my tent I noticed a few spots where people had obviously started fires before and my caveman brain took over as I decided I need to start a fire. I began collecting sticks, looking out for rat's tails and cat's tails (or something like that), that would be perfect for starting a fire. With a little help from my burning alcohol I quickly started a fire and then quickly realised I did not have anywhere near enough sticks or anything that would actually burn for a substantial amount of time. I frantically ran around for a little while searching for a log or some girthier sticks however I had no luck. My dream of burning campfire was extinguished and I had to settle with just cooking on my stove. After eating and cleaning up I headed to bed, ready for another day on the bike tomorrow.

Three days into my cycling journey from England to Spain, I'm still processing that I actually did it. After three months of planning, the reality of this leap still hasn't quite sunk in.

#### Exeter to Plymouth

I began the journey towards the ferry with goodbyes and watery eyes. After living in Exeter for 7 years I was looking forward to a final trek over Dartmoor to catch my ferry from Plymouth. The sun was shining as I left, however this quickly changed as I approached the edge of Dartmoor and its ever unpredictable weather. Luckily the rain was light and warm; if anything it provided respite from the hills taking me up to the top of the moor.

As I pushed on over the crest of Dartmoor, with the climbing done for the day, just a lovely descent left, I spotted a peculiar sight ahead of me, 8 cyclists in full high vis. I thought it was the safest cycling club I have ever seen. As I managed to catch up to them, the sweat was already visible. After a quick chat, it turns out they were Chagford fire department (explains the attire) on a charity cycle to Benidorm. I wouldn't have expected a different final destination to be honest.

I quickly fired on past (pun intended) as I wanted to arrive in Plymouth with time to get some scran. The final ~25km into Plymouth is a lovely cycle path but unfortunately on a bank holiday Sunday this is full of lovely people. Along the trail, I caught up to a fellow bikepacker Odie who absolutely loved the clown horn my housemate-landlord extraordinaire had bought me as a leaving gift (with the added bonus of being painted bright pink). The horn was doing absolute work though; not only was it parting the crowds it caused Odie to erupt with laughter. The recipients of the honks had similar responses too.

I cycled with Odie into Plymouth, hearing of his plans to cycle LEJOG and head off to Thailand in the winter. We parted ways as I headed to a fish and chip shop by the ferry port for a final taste of British cuisine before heading across the sea to Santander, Spain.

#### Overnight to Spain

I boarded the ferry at about 4pm and quickly went on the hunt for a shower. I had low expectations, I had only reserved a chair (no shower included) and the previous ferry I had been on did not have any showers for the frugal passengers. To my surprise I found, first a kids swimming pool aboard and nearby a shower and changing room meaning I could escape my slightly damp cycling kit.

The ferry was mostly uneventful, as expected I had a rough nights sleep trying to get comfy on the semi-reclined chair surrounded by snorers. My plan for the morning was to treat myself to the fancy buffet breakfast, my thinking being unlimited coffee will solve the lack sleep and the endless food will fuel me for 2 whole meal + whatever I could sneak into bag. I ended up going for 4 rounds and collecting a bounty of pastries in my bag.

The ferry landed in Santander at 2pm and I made a quick getaway, by filtering down the passport control queues with 2 other cyclist. We chatted briefly before parting way, I knew roughly where I was going as I had done the inverse journey on a previous cyclin holiday, however I quickly made a wrong turn and ended up in an industrial estate the wrong side of the motorway. As I was consulting our lord and saviour google maps 2 cyclists approach, lo and behold it was the same cyclists from the ferry. Turns out our chat on directions hadnt been clear at and we had both made the same mistake. We then parted ways for the second time as they decided to just make a u-turn while I headed on to tackle what appeared to Santanders answer to spaghetti junction.

#### Finding camp

The plan for the day was to cycle ~30km to find first somewhere to camp before continuing on to Bilbao the next day. I had done some "research" into potential camping spots on the ferry. The research mainly entailed browsing google maps for about half an hour and being very grateful that google street view exists. The issue with this though is that no matter how good a spot looks on google street view there will inevitably be something wrong with it in real life. You quickly learn that all the best looking fields will have some form of livestock in and never fancy sharing my sleeping spot with a bunch of horned cows. So of course the spots I had scouted out came and went until I stumble across what appeared to be a self service caravan park with an honesty box for payment. One of the spots had enough grass to pitch my tent so I thought I would take the risk and set up here for the night.

Shortly after I had set up camp the owner of the site came by. As he approached I could tell he was going to put my Spanish skills to the test. He was perfectly happy with me camping there; his biggest concern seemed to be where I was going to go to the toilet as he kindly offered for me to use his bathroom at his house next door. I obliged and then returned to my tent to have some dinner and head to bed.

The next day I set off towards Bilbao at about 9am. I had booked a hostel to stay in for the night and as it was relatively flat 80km route I was looking forward to arriving with plenty of time to explore and, most importantly, find a bikeshop to buy some new brake pads from.

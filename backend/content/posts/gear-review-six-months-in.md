# Gear Review: Six Months In

When I left the UK in March, my bike weighed a hefty 42kg fully loaded. Today, that weight is down to 31kg, and I don't miss a single item I've shed along the way. Here's my comprehensive review of what worked, what didn't, and what surprised me after half a year on the road.

## The Bicycle: Surly Long Haul Trucker

### The Good
- **Reliability**: Not a single structural issue despite rough roads
- **Comfort**: The steel frame absorbs road chatter effectively
- **Tire Clearance**: Being able to run 2.0" tires made some rough sections manageable

### The Bad
- **Weight**: At 14kg unloaded, it's heavy for climbing
- **Gearing**: Should have opted for lower gearing for Alpine passes

## Camping Gear

### Winners
1. **Hilleberg Akto Tent**: Withstood a vicious storm in the Pyrenees that destroyed three tents around me
2. **Sea to Summit Ultralight Sleeping Mat**: 220 nights and still no leaks
3. **Jetboil Stove System**: Boils water in under 2 minutes, critical for morning coffee motivation

### Losers
1. ~~**Solar Charger**~~: Too heavy, too slow, never generated enough power to be useful
2. ~~**Camping Chair**~~: Nice but unnecessary luxury, ditched in Slovenia
3. ~~**Too Many Cooking Utensils**~~: Started with a full kit, now use just a spork and pocket knife

## Clothing System

After six months of daily riding, I've refined my clothing to the absolute essentials:

| Category | Items Kept | Items Discarded |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Cycling  | 2 jerseys, 2 bib shorts, 1 jacket | 1 jersey, rain pants |
| Camp/Casual | 1 pair shorts, 1 pants, 2 t-shirts | 2 shirts, 1 pants, sweater |
| Shoes | Cycling shoes, camp sandals | Walking shoes |

The key lesson: **You need far less than you think.** Almost every town has a laundromat, and clothing can be washed and dried overnight in most accommodations.

## Technology

My approach to technology has been minimalist but vital for documenting the journey:

- **Smartphone**: The true MVP - navigation, communication, camera, and entertainment
- **Anker PowerCore 20000**: Reliably powers everything for 3-4 days between charges
- **Bluetooth Keyboard**: Makes updating this blog manageable without carrying a laptop

## Unexpected MVP Gear

Some items I almost didn't bring have proven invaluable:

1. **Dental Floss**: Beyond oral hygiene, it's been emergency sewing thread, clothesline, and even fixed a broken pannier clip
2. **Buff Headwear**: Used it as a face mask, beanie, sun protection, and impromptu coffee filter
3. **Silicone Earplugs**: Essential for sleeping in noisy hostels or campgrounds

## Conclusion

The longer I travel, the more I realize that happiness on the road comes from carrying less, not more. Each item discarded feels like shedding weight both physically and mentally.

For those planning a similar journey, remember: **You can buy almost anything you need on the road, but you can't buy back the energy wasted carrying things you don't need.**

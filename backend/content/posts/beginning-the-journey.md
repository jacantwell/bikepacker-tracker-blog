# Beginning the Journey

The rain was persistent as I pushed off from Dover, my bike loaded with what seemed like too little for the journey ahead, yet somehow still too much. Four panniers, a handlebar bag, and the endless road stretching out before me.

## The Plan (or lack thereof)

I've been planning this trip for years, or perhaps more accurately, I've been dreaming about it. The actual planning part? Well, that came together in the last three months:

- **Route**: UK → France → Belgium → Netherlands → Germany → and then... we'll see
- **Timeline**: Open-ended, but roughly 18 months if all goes well
- **Budget**: £25 per day average (hoping to wild camp and stay with hosts where possible)

## First Day Challenges

The ferry crossing was smooth enough, but French roads immediately presented their own character. The route from Calais took me through small villages where I stumbled through conversations with my limited French. 

> "Je voyage à vélo à... everywhere?" I explained to a curious shopkeeper, who laughed and loaded me up with an extra pain au chocolat for the road.

The first night I found a small wooded area just outside Saint-Omer. Setting up my tent for the first time on the journey felt momentous - this small nylon shelter would be my home for hundreds of nights to come.

## Equipment Learnings

Already I'm questioning some of my gear choices:

1. The solar charger seems like overkill when I'm passing through towns regularly
2. I packed too many clothes and not enough snacks
3. My stove is efficient but fiddly in the wind

Tomorrow I head toward Lille, and then the plan is to cross into Belgium by the weekend. The forecast shows clear skies, and my legs are already adapting to their new daily purpose.

As the saying goes: *The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single pedal stroke*. Or something like that.
